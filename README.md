### Who are we? 
Zenfit is a danish health tech scale-up which provides the solution for Personal Trainers to manage their businesses and clients.
We offer trainers an All-in-One solution, which allows them to automate payments, and streamline communication, update meal- & workout plans, and much more.
Our customers (who are often referred to as Online Coaches or PTs) provide their clients with a personalized experience, through our Expo App.

### The project 💬
This project represents a small, but very essential part of our software: The meal planner.
Our customers use the meal plan generator very frequently to create meal plans for their clients.
This tool allows trainers to go from using 1 hour to creating a meal plan, to being able to deliver their clients with tailored meal plans within a few seconds.
The project contains the overview of an already created meal plan, where you can rearrange and add recipes.

### What we expect from you 🤔
We expect you to prove both your communication and technical capabilities as a hardcore frontend engineer.
At Zenfit we work together on finding solutions that will lead us to the best user experience in the end, so it's important that you are able to communicate your thoughts and ideas.
We enjoy having a lean product, clean code, and well-thought-out solutions.

### The task 📝
The task is to dig into the project, and focus on these four key areas:

- Frontend - How satisfied are you with the modular architecture and its components?
  - What are the pros and cons of the current architecture and what are the consequences of these?

- Implementation - How would you integrate Typescript into this project?
  - What would be your approach, so you can work smart and not hard?
  
- Testing - How would you formulate a testing strategy for the project?
  - Write a test in Jest or Cypress that tests some key functionality of the code.

##### Bonus key areas to focus on:
- Extension - What choices would you make if extending this project from MVP to production-grade code?
- Scalability - How would you evaluate the scalability of the code?


### Hint 🤫

Imagine that a colleague would need an introduction to this project and would need to get a general idea of the structure.
What is worth keeping and what needs some work. Remember to be as specific as possible with code examples.
